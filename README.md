# Automated-Voltage-Stabilizer-System
This project improves power system reliability using a voltage stabilizer for overload protection.
~Voltage stabilizers protect electrical appliances like air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators, and computers from voltage fluctuations.
~They act as a protective shield, reducing the risk of equipment malfunction.
~Short circuits and overloads are major faults in power systems, causing power distribution changes, energy loss, and equipment damage.
~These faults impact the stability and reliability of the power system, affecting the normal operation of electrical equipment.
~The project focuses on improving power system reliability by implementing overload and short circuit protection through the use of a voltage stabilizer.
